# Capstone Project: Maverik 🚀

## Business Problem 🏪

The Maverik capstone project tackled the challenge of expanding the business footprint with the goal of opening approximately 30 new stores in the upcoming year. Key objectives included predicting everyday sales for new stores, improving forecast accuracy for financial planning, and refining Initial Return on Investment (ROI) calculations.

## Proposed Solution 📊

Our solution centered around the development of a robust predictive model using Time Series analysis. This involved forecasting annual sales, suggesting sales enhancement strategies, and identifying influential variables for accurate predictions.

## My Contribution 🌟

I led the creation of an XGBoost and Prophet model that outperformed the existing solution, boasting a 25% lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The XGBoost model factored in the first week's sales of the store and predicted future sales based on historical patterns. Training the model on a year's worth of historical data contributed to its accuracy.

## Business Value 💼

The implemented solution delivered significant business value by improving inventory management, reducing waste, optimizing price allocation, and enhancing overall financial planning.

## Challenges Faced 🤔

Our team navigated challenges stemming from the computational intensity of the project. We optimized the time series code to enable predictions based on a few weeks' data. Initial concerns about data sufficiency led to feature engineering for more meaningful results.

## Key Learnings 🧠

The project provided valuable insights into leadership, effective communication of technical findings to non-technical audiences, and the intricacies of time series forecasting.
