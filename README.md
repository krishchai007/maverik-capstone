# Capstone Project: Maverik

# Business Problem
# The Maverik capstone project aimed to address the challenge of increasing the business footprint by approximately 30 new stores in the upcoming year. The primary objectives were to predict the everyday sales of new stores, enhance forecast accuracy for financial planning, and improve the precision of Initial Return on Investment (ROI) calculations.

# Proposed Solution
# Our proposed solution involved the development of a robust predictive model utilizing Time Series analysis. The key components included forecasting annual sales for the upcoming year, suggesting strategies to enhance sales, and identifying influential variables for predictions.

# My Contribution
# I spearheaded the creation of an XGBoost and Prophet model that outperformed the existing solution, boasting a 25% lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The XGBoost model considered the first week's sales of the store and predicted future sales based on historical patterns. Training the model on a year's worth of historical data contributed to its accuracy.

# Business Value
# The implemented solution delivered significant business value by improving inventory management, reducing waste, optimizing price allocation, and enhancing overall financial planning.

# Challenges
# Our team encountered challenges due to the computational intensity of the project. We optimized the time series code to enable predictions based on a few weeks' data. Additionally, initial concerns about data sufficiency led to feature engineering to obtain more meaningful results.

# Key Learnings
# The project provided valuable insights into leadership, effective communication of technical findings to non-technical audiences, and the intricacies of time series forecasting.

# Feel free to explore the project and its findings in the repository. Your feedback and suggestions are welcomed!
